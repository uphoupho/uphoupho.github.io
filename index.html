                    <div class="item_detail">
                            <br>I am a senior undergraduate student in Chu Kochen Honors College at Zhejiang University. I am majoring in Automation(Robotics Track) and applying for the 2020 Fall Ph.D. program. I got full marks in many maths and physics courses and developed a solid foundation in mathematics and physics. What's more, I obtained a GPA of 3.92/4.0 and ranked top 5%. My research interests lie in the area of Robotics, Graph Similarity Search, Graph Representation Learning and Microfluidics. I am particular eager to study micro-scale robotics and bioinspired robotics and explore fundamental questions related with them. What's more, I am interested in studying graph neural networks, with their applications in language processing, graph mining, etc.</br>
                            <br>I am fortunate to work as an undergraduate researcher in ZJU, Harvard University and UCLA. I hope to distill the underlying physical principles in robots and apply my findings, together with my knowledge in electronics and computer science techniques to enable novel functions in robots and smart medical devices. When I was a freshman, I entered the small size soccer robot lab to conduct research on multi-agent collaboration and develop a new generation of soccer robots. Finally, I won the world champion of 2018 RoboCup Canada International Competition.</br>
                            <br>However, after winning the world champion, I started to seek for more novelty and more challenges, which is unable to be fulfilled by engineering-oriented works. I heard my spirit calling, an unquenchable thirst started growing in my heart, telling me that relying on skills and experience to develop our robots is far from enough, and that I should focus more on principle and theoretical studies. And what kind of principle and theoretical studies is underlying there? Machine learning algorithms and physics models. As a result, these two years, I mainly conducted research on data science and applied physics, with my long-lasting dream, that one day I will bring breakthrough development into robotics by advanced machine learning algorithms and accurate physical models, buried deeply in my heart.</br>

                        <p><b>Project 1: A Faster Graph Similarity Computation Approach Based on Graph Partitioning and Graph Neural Network</b></p>
                        <p>• Major contribution: Proposed a novel graph partitioning and graph neural network based model, called PSimGNN, to effectively conduct coarse-grained and fine-grained similarity computation of any pair of graphs.</p>
                        <p>• Model: First, partition each of the input graph into a set of subgraphs. Second, design and use a learnable embedding function that maps every subgraph into an embedding vector. Then conduct coarse-grained similarity computation by computing the similarity of each pair of subgraphs’ subgraph-level embedding vectors. Third, select some of these subgraph pairs for node-level comparison to supplement the subgraph-level embeddings with fine-grained node-level information. We compute each chosen subgraph pair’s similarity score by jointly reasoning on the pair through a cross-graph attention-based matching mechanism.</p>
                        <p>• Our model is especially effective in graph structure similarity computation of large graphs, compared with other state-of-the-art graph similarity computation models which need quadratic time with respect to the number of nodes in two graphs.</p>
                        <p>• Meaning: By combining graph partitioning or graph coarsening methods with deep graph similarity learning models, our study suggests PSimGNN provides a new direction for future research on graph similarity computation and graph similarity search.</p>
                        <p>• About to submit a paper to a top conference as the first author.</p></br>
