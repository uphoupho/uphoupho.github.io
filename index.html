                    <div class="item_detail">
                            <br>I am a senior undergraduate student in Chu Kochen Honors College at Zhejiang University. I am majoring in Automation(Robotics Track) and applying for the 2021 Fall Ph.D. program. I got full marks in many maths and physics courses and developed a solid foundation in mathematics and physics. What's more, I obtained a GPA of 3.92/4.0 and ranked top 5%. My research interests lie in the area of Graph Representation Learning, Time Series Analysis, Robot Learning and Microfluidics. I am particular interested in graph neural networks, with their applications in language processing, graph mining, etc. What's more, I like studying micro-scale robotics and bioinspired robotics and explore fundamental questions related with them. </br>
                            <br>I am fortunate to work as an undergraduate researcher in ZJU, Harvard University and UCLA. I hope to distill the underlying physical principles in robots and apply my findings, together with my knowledge in electronics and computer science techniques to enable novel functions in robots and smart medical devices. When I was a freshman, I entered the small size soccer robot lab to conduct research on multi-agent collaboration and develop a new generation of soccer robots. Finally, I won the world champion of 2018 RoboCup Canada International Competition.</br>
                            <br>However, after winning the world champion, I started to seek for more novelty and more challenges, which is unable to be fulfilled by engineering-oriented works. I heard my spirit calling, an unquenchable thirst started growing in my heart, telling me that relying on skills and experience to develop our robots is far from enough, and that I should focus more on principle and theoretical studies. And what kind of principle and theoretical studies is underlying there? Machine learning algorithms and physics models. As a result, these two years, I mainly conducted research on data science and applied physics, with my long-lasting dream, that one day I will bring breakthrough development into robotics by advanced machine learning algorithms and accurate physical models, buried deeply in my heart.</br>
